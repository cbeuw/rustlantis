# Rustlantis
A Rust Mid-level Intermediate Representation fuzzer

It can generate [custom MIR](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/intrinsics/mir/index.html) programs containing:
- All primitive integer and floating point types, `bool`, `char`, arrays,
tuples, raw pointers, and structs.
- Functions containing multiple basic blocks
- Terminators: `Goto`, `Return`, `SwitchInt` (`match`), `Call`.
- Intrinsic functions: `arith_offset` (for pointer arithmetics), `transmute`,
`bswap`, `fmaf64`.
- Operators: all arithmetic, logical and bitwise operations on integers
and floating points, and checked arithmetic (Add, Sub, Mul) on integers
- All primitive literal expressions, as well as tuple, array, and struct
aggregate expressions
- Creating pointers with `addr_of!` and `addr_of_mut!`, and dereferencing
- Casts between integers, floating points, `char`, and `bool`

Generated programs are terminating, UB-free, and deterministic. A discrepancy between testing backends
always indicate a bug in them (or a bug in Rustlantis).

## Requirements
- Rust nightly
- rustup

## Config
Copy `config.toml.example` to `config.toml` and supply the paths to the *repository root* of testing backends.

To prepare `rustc_codegen_cranelift`:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bjorn3/rustc_codegen_cranelift
cd rustc_codegen_cranelift && ./y.rs prepare && ./y.rs build
```

To prepare Miri:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rust-lang/miri
cargo install rustup-toolchain-install-master
cd miri && ./miri toolchain && ./miri build --release && ./target/release/cargo-miri miri setup
```

## Usage

To generate and difftest one seed, run

```bash
./fuzz-one.sh <seed>
```

A program will be generated to `$TMPDIR` and tested. If difftest passes (no bug), it will exit with 0. If difftest spots a difference between testing backends, it will exit with 1 and save the reproduction file to `./repros/`.

To generate a program only, run `generate`
```
Usage: generate [OPTIONS] <seed>

Arguments:
  <seed>  generation seed

Options:
  -d, --debug    generate a program where values are printed instead of hashed (slow)
  -h, --help     Print help
  -V, --version  Print version
```

To difftest an existing program, run `difftest`
```
Usage: difftest <file>

Arguments:
  <file>  

Options:
  -h, --help  Print help
```

## Quirks
- Cranelift not supported on AArch64 macOS: https://github.com/bjorn3/rustc_codegen_cranelift/issues/1248
- `rustc_codegen_backend` can be used as a backend, but it doesn't support enough language features yet to be usable
